###This is the report for practical-2.
<p>
Î™n this project I had to find errors in code that I did not write. 
Finding and correcting other developers' mistakes is probably the hardest thing you can do for the simple reason that you do not know what is where.
On the other hand it is quite challenging and can make you understand the process somewhat differently.

<p>
Hopefully, I had the experience to find those errors on the go which means that I didn't use debugger at all.
Although the debugger is the best tool to use in situations like this I didn't use it.
I was able to deal with the errors just by skimming the code once I understand  what game does.

I decided to keep the functionality of the A card . In order for the game to be played smoothly, card A must remain as is like a tool card that you can discard anytime, no matter the card on top.

<p>
Overall, the project was challenging enough but not hard.
I was able to see code from another perspective and that was helpful 
in order for me to understand what I see and be able to identify errors.
